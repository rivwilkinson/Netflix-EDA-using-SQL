# Netflix-EDA-using-SQL
I used SQL Server to manipulate and analyze my Netflix viewing history data. I exported my data from my Netflix account and had an Excel file that contained two columns, one for Title and the second for viewing Date and 151 rows. I added a primary key to the dataset and imported the data into a database I created in SQL Server. From there I began to build out the dataset to include columns for Season, Episode Name, Category (movie/show), and Genre. After I cleaned and prepared the data, I explored my viewing history using different aggregate functions. I learned that my favorite genre is sci-f, my least favorite genre is crime, my most watched show is Space Force, my least watched show is Designated Survivor, I've watched 15 movies this year (2023), and since 11/2022 I've watched an average of 2 show/movies a day.
